Wednesbury flood: Road turned into river by digger hitting pipe
A contractor on a mechanical digger accidentally smashed through a water pipe causing flooding that damaged homes and submerged cars.
Engineers have been working overnight to repair the burst main in Leabrook Road, in Wednesbury, Sandwell.
Water levels reached 3m (9.8ft) after a 2m (6.5ft) hole was made in the pipe at about 10:30 BST on Thursday.
Three schools remained shut on Friday, Sandwell Council said. Surrounding roads reopened at about 09:00.

Water supplies were lost for about two hours, South Staffordshire Water said, but the repairs have since finished and the supply is back on.
The floodwater has left debris and mud in the road, along with damaged cars.
"It was quite a spectacular eruption," Pete Aspley, from South Staffordshire Water, said.
"It was a contractor working on the electricity network on a mechanical digger that physically hit the main and led to catastrophic failure."
The digger, being used by a worker from Western Power Distribution, hit a 24in mains pipe.
Ten cars were left submerged in the road and fire service divers were sent to the scene.
The firm isolated the power supply at the local sub-station as a precautionary measure in case floodwater reached it.
