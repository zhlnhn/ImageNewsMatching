Olympian criticised for swimming pool anecdote
When Lizzie Simmonds posted a humorous anecdote on Twitter she had no inkling of what was in store over the next forty eight hours.
"I thought a few people might think it would be funny" the British Olympian told the BBC. She was referring to a misunderstanding between her and another lady at a public swimming pool in Edinburgh last Friday.
The lady had told Lizzie she should consider pursuing the sport seriously. When Lizzie told her she'd been to the Olympics a couple of times the lady presumed she meant as a spectator not as a competitor. Lizzie found the whole interaction and her own awkwardness very amusing. "She was very sweet".
"I wouldn't usually be in a public session but I had to make up some training so I could visit my other half over the weekend in Bristol" she said.
"The lady was in the lane next to me. She naturally presumed I wasn't in a club because I was in the public session."
At first Lizzie got a positive reaction to her tweet. "That's wonderful" exclaimed an early reply to her story.
